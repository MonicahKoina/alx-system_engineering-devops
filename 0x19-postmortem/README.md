Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which was not optimized to handle a sudden spike in user traffic. This caused uneven distribution of requests, leading to server overload and high response times.
Resolution:

The DevOps team reviewed and corrected the load balancer settings to ensure proper distribution of incoming traffic.
Additional server instances were temporarily spun up to handle the increased load.
A thorough check of all related configurations was conducted to prevent recurrence.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Improve load balancer configurations to handle traffic spikes more effectively.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect similar issues more quickly.
Review and optimize server scaling policies to ensure rapid response to increased traffic.
Tasks:

Optimize Load Balancer Settings:
Adjust and test load balancer configurations to ensure even traffic distribution.
Implement Auto-Scaling:
Configure auto-scaling policies to automatically add server instances during traffic spikes.
Enhance Monitoring:
Add detailed monitoring on server performance metrics, including CPU, memory usage, and network traffic.
Conduct Stress Testing:
Regularly perform stress tests to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust configurations accordingly.
Update Incident Response Procedures:
Review and update incident response protocols to ensure quicker identification and resolution of similar issues.
